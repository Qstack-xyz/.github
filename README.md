# AlgoBuilders Quadratic Funding (QF) Platform

## Abstract
Quadratic Funding (QF) represents a democratized way to allocate funds for public goods based on the community's preferences. This whitepaper aims to design and articulate the process of implementing a QF platform on the Algorand blockchain. The materials and references from various GitHub repositories and articles have been employed to produce a detailed, comprehensive solution tailored to the Algorand ecosystem.

**Introduction.md**

### 1. Introduction
Quadratic Funding allows communities to match fund projects according to the preferences of individual contributors. It has the potential to transform how public goods are funded by incentivizing community-driven projects with added financial support from matching pools.

**QuadraticFundingPrinciples.md**

### 2. Quadratic Funding Principles
Quadratic Funding is based on the principle of democratic financial participation. Funds are matched based on the amount donated and the number of contributors.
Benefits:
- Democratizes financial decision-making.
- Encourages grassroots initiatives and support.
- Bridges the gap between wealthy donors and everyday contributors.

### 3. Algorand Ecosystem and Its Benefits
Algorand offers advantages such as:
- Fast transaction speed.
- Finality of transactions.
- Scalability.
- Low transaction fees.
The Algorand consensus mechanism ensures a reliable and secure platform for our QF implementation.

### 4. Design and Architecture
- **4.1 Smart Contracts:** Using OpenZeppelin's contracts as a foundation, combined with Algorand's native support for smart contracts, we can ensure security and reliability in our QF platform.
- **4.2 Data Structures:** 
  - Projects: Holds details of each project, including current funds, number of contributors, etc.
  - Funds: Maintains a record of funds and their distribution.
- **4.3 Matching Mechanism:** The formula for Quadratic Funding is:
\[ \text{Matched funds} = (\sqrt{\text{contributed funds} + 1} - 1)^2 \]

### 5. Implementation Details
- **5.1 Crowdfunding Model on Algorand:** Using Algorandâ€™s atomic transfers, it becomes easy to create a secured crowdfunding application, which forms the base for our QF platform.
- **5.2 Security:** We can ensure robust security in our platform through OpenZeppelin contracts and Algorand's consensus mechanism.

## Abstract (AlgoBuilders QF)
AlgoBuilders QF aims to integrate the innovative quadratic funding mechanism into the Algorand ecosystem. By rallying the academic vigor of students across numerous universities and blockchain clubs, AlgoBuilders seeks to revolutionize funding by employing the Algorand blockchain.

### Introduction
Quadratic Funding (QF) is an alternative mechanism for funding public goods. This model optimizes for both the number of contributors and the amount they contribute. Algorand, a high-speed blockchain platform, provides the necessary tools for deploying scalable, decentralized applications that can benefit from the QF model. This project leverages Algorand's capabilities and the rising interest in quadratic funding for a novel solution.

### The Quadratic Funding Model
Quadratic Funding works by using a formula to calculate the amount of matching funds a project will receive based on the number of individual contributors and the amount they contribute. This ensures that projects that garner wider community support receive a higher proportion of matching funds. For a deeper insight, refer to wtfisqf.com.
